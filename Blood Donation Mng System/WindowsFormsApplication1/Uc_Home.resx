    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made 
into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation
 (separation of whole-blood components).
 Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (the latter called apheresis).
 Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.
Today in the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply.
 In some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation).
 Many donors donate for several reasons, such as a form of charity, general awareness regarding the demand for blood, increased confidence in oneself,
 helping a personal friend/relative, and social pressure.
 Despite the many reasons that people donate. Not enough potential donors actively donate. However
, this is reversed during disasters when blood donations increase, often creating an excess supply that will have to be later discarded. 
However, in countries that allow paid donation some people are paid, 
and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. 
People can also have blood drawn for their own future use (autologous donation). 
Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.
Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis.
 The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health.
 How often a donor can donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place.
 For example, in the United States, donors must wait eight weeks (56 days) between whole blood donations but only seven days between plateletpheresis 
donations and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis.[1]

The amount of blood drawn and the methods vary. The collection can be done manually or with automated equipment that takes only specific components of the blood.
 Most of the components of blood used for transfusions have a short shelf life, and maintaining a constant supply is a persistent problem. 
This has led to some increased interest in autotransfusion</value>
